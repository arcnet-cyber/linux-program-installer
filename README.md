# linux-program-installer
a cross platform program installer designed for beginners to get used to linux 

Im still currently testing it across different platforms but it potentally 

## Currently functional on:
-Arch  





## Installing

### Git-clone method

```
git clone https://github.com/arcnet-cyber/linux-program-installer.git
cd ~/linux-program-installer/XPlatormInstaller
./setup.sh
```
The alias "installer" should then be added 
Executing "installer" in your Terminal should run the program

### Manual download

1. Download the folder and using terminal, Navigate to its downloaded location (Usually ~/Downloads) and then into its deeper folder called XPlatformInstaller
2. Type the command below to install dependancies and add the alias for you to type into terminal

```
./setup.sh
```
The alias "installer" should then be added 
Executing "installer" in your Terminal should run the program


## Uninstalling

Run uninstall.sh to remove the alias and project files

## Dependancies

So this only runs using BASH and Python3 so easy enough to install and test out.
The install.sh script will install the dependancies for you.
